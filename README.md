## Communication and Protocols

**REST API:** Used for predictable CRUD operations (authentication, profiles, friends, avatar management).

**WebSocket:** Used for real-time bidirectional communication during gameplay and matchmaking.

**HTTP/HTTPS:** HTTPS is used for secure client-to-server communication and all backend operations via Nginx. Communication between frontend and game services within the Docker network uses HTTP.  HTTP is also responsible for carrying JWT authentication cookies.

**Nginx:** Acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests to backend services and handling TLS termination.

**Data Format (Notation):** JSON for API communication and Markdown for project documentation.

# Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Docker ([install](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/))
2. Docker Compose ([install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))
3. Make tool ([install](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/guides/make-install.html))
4. Rename .env_example file as .env and update credentials
5. Make sure port 3000 and 8443 are not in use

### Installation
1. Clone git repository in your local directory
```bash
	git clone git@github.com:AnselmiVeikko/ft_transcendence.git
```

2. Build and start all the docker containers

```bash
	cd ft_transcendence

	make run
```

### Usage
Navigate (Note: You may receive a security warning because the site uses a self-signed TLS certificate. Click “Advanced” and then “Proceed to localhost (unsafe)” to continue browsing)
```
	https://localhost:8443
```


### Clean
To stop and remove all the containers and volumes run

```
	make clean
```

# Project Management

For this project, we mainly used discord for communication.
We would have weekly meetings, with the date decided by vote.
In said meetings, we went over current tasks and split the workload.
We used GitHub Projects for logging progress and current tasks.


# Individual Contributions

## ahentton

### Contributions
- Designing the schema/response infrastructure for the backend.
